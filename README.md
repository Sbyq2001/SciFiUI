# SciFi UI Project

Name: Sultan Algahtani

Student Number: D18129378

# Description of the assignment
The code implements a sci-fi UI in processing Java demonstrating the use of variable, loops, methods, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, unit circle, trigonometry, push and matrix and translate.
Note: a transparent rectangle is placed as background to create a fading effect.
Also, the entire sketch is translated to have the origin in the middle of the screen

# Instructions
1.Â Â Â  Download the project, make sure Java is installed. 
2.Â Â Â  Compile the project using the compile script file.
3.Â Â Â  Run the project using the script file.
4.Â Â Â  Make sure your speaker is on so you can hear the music.
5.Â Â Â  Move the mouse to the left upper corner to see the student details
6.Â Â Â  Enjoy the music and with the panel theme ðŸ¥³

# How it works
Almost every piece its broken down to small functions to cut down the complexity of the views. This project is using a useful processing library (PApplet).
Â 
sliderCircle() function is responsible for showing the circle in the left upper corner which gets bigger if you hover over the circle
Â 
sliderViewSultan() function is responsible for the view that slides from left to right with my info regarding the name, dob, and current status
Â 
mainCircle() function is responsible for the outer layer circle in the center of the screen.
Â 
RainbowCircle() function is the inner side circle which are circles with different colors.
Â 
Radar() function is responsible for the radar navigation in the right bottom of the panel screen
Â 
RadarBar() function is responsible for the left bottom which is for showing different control moving upward and downward.
Â 
layerCircle() is responsible for showing the layers of a circle in the right side of the screen. 

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The accomplishment Iâ€™m most proud of is completing this assignment after a difficult times I went through during semester 2. Itâ€™s a reflection of a hard work and discipline, as well as my ability to code and learn some new things in Java processing. I hope I continue to learn and grow in the gaming industry.
